  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p class="one">Hi! I’m Aritra, a 10th-grade student at Thomas A. Edison High School. This year, I’m learning about web development, and I’m really excited to be starting this journey. Even though this is my first website, I’m eager to learn and improve my skills. I’ve always loved working with computers, and coding has been a great way for me to dive deeper into tech.</p>
  
  <p class="two">As I continue to learn, I’m looking forward to creating more projects and building my skills along the way. I hope you enjoy exploring my site and following my progress!</p>
